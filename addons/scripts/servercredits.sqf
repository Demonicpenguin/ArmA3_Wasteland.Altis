/*	SCRIPT NAME: Server Intro Credits Script by IT07
/*	SCRIPT VERSION: v1.3.5 BETA

//	========== SCRIPT CONFIG ============
	
_onScreenTime = 8; 		//how long one role should stay on screen. Use value from 0 to 10 where 0 is almost instant transition to next role 
//NOTE: Above value is not in seconds!
 
//	==== HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE CREDITS ===
//	If you want more or less credits on the screen, you have to add/remove roles.
//	Watch out though, you need to make sure BOTH role lists match eachother in terms of amount.
//	Just take a good look at the _role1 and the rest and you will see what I mean.
 
//	For further explanation of it all, I included some info in the code.
 
//	== HOW TO CUSTOMIZE THE COLOR OF CREDITS ==
//	Find line **** and look for: color='#C80000'
//	The numbers and letters between the 2 '' is the HTML color code for a certain yellow.
//	If you want to change the color of the text, search on google for HTML color codes and pick the one your like.
//	Then, replace the existing color code for the code you would like to use instead. Don't forget the # in front of it.
//	HTML Color Codes Examples:	
//	#FFFFFF (white)
//	#000000 (black)	No idea why you would want black, but whatever
//	#C80000 (red)
//	#009FCF (light-blue)
//	#31C300 (Razer Green)			
//	#FF8501 (orange)
